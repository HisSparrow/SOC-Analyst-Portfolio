# 🔐 Firewall History & Network Security

This repository contains beginner-friendly notes on firewall generations, key concepts, and a short quiz to test understanding.  
Ideal for cybersecurity students or portfolio reference.

## **1️⃣ First Generation Firewalls**
**Packet Filtering Firewalls** (1980s)  

**Key Features:**  
- Stateless (does not track sessions)  
- Inspects individual packets based on:  
  - Source IP  
  - Destination IP  
  - Source port  
  - Destination port  
  - Protocol type (TCP/UDP/ICMP)  

**Example:**  
192.168.100.10 : TCP / 49152 → 142.250.1.92 : TCP / 80- Internal host connecting to a web server on port 80  

**OSI Layers:** Layer 3 (Network), Layer 4 (Transport)  

**Strengths:**  
- Fast and lightweight  
- Easy to configure  

**Limitations:**  
- Cannot track sessions (stateless)  
- No application-level awareness  

**Memory Tip:**  
> 1st Gen = IPs + Ports + Protocols (No memory)

## **2️⃣ Second Generation Firewalls**
**Stateful Inspection Firewalls** (Late 1990s – 2000s)  

**Key Features:**  
- Tracks active network connections using a **state table**  
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)  
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) capabilities  
- Improved security over packet filtering  

**OSI Layers:** Primarily Layer 3 & Layer 4, begins inspecting Layer 7  

**Strengths:**  
- Blocks unsolicited or suspicious traffic  
- Understands session context  

**Memory Tip:**  
> 2nd Gen = Remembers connections (Stateful)

---

## **3️⃣ Third Generation Firewalls**
**Next-Generation Firewalls (NGFWs)**  

**Key Features:**  
- Application-aware and user-aware  
- User identity integration (e.g., Active Directory)  
- Threat intelligence integration (e.g., MISP feeds)  
- Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)  
- Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)  
- Malware and exploit detection  

**OSI Layers:** Layer 3 → Layer 7  

**Example Question:**  
- Traditional: “Allow traffic from IP A to IP B on port 80?”  
- NGFW: “Should John from Marketing access Facebook over HTTPS during work hours, and is this traffic malicious?”  

**Memory Tip:**  
> 3rd Gen = Users + Apps + Threats

## **📊 Quick Comparison Table**

| Generation | Type                     | Stateful | App Awareness | Example Question |
|------------|--------------------------|----------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1st        | Packet Filtering         | ❌ No    | ❌ No         | IP + Port       |
| 2nd        | Stateful Inspection      | ✅ Yes   | ⚠ Limited     | Is this session valid? |
| 3rd        | Next-Gen Firewall (NGFW) | ✅ Yes   | ✅ Yes        | Who, what app, what threat? |

## **🧒 Explain It Like You’re 12**
- **1st Gen:** Checks addresses and doors  
- **2nd Gen:** Remembers who already walked in  
- **3rd Gen:** Knows who you are, what app you’re using, and whether it’s dangerous
